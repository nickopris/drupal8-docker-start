# drupal8-docker-start
  These are a bunch of scripts to help with creating a development environment for Drupal 8 and Docker on Mac OSX.

# Prerequisites

- Install [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
- Install docker-sync - 
```gem install docker-sync```

# How to run
- in Terminal run ```bash init.sh```

# Available commands
- ```bash start.sh``` - will start containers and docker-sync + your start homepage in browser
- ```bash stop.sh``` - will stop containers - db does not get removed because it's local
-```bash restart.sh``` - will stop containers and docker-sync and then restart these, no db is lost


# Behind the scenes
- the scripts will:
  - create a directory for database so that if you kill docker you will not lose the db 
  - downloads Drupal8 latest
  - pulls (if needed) and installs all required Docker images
  - runs the containers 
  - performs a wait so that the files will be copied across from volumes
  - docker-sync will remain in listen mode and will sync files as they get changed
  - opens the start page of the Drupal site
  
  # Debugging
  I use Kitematic to investigate containers. If a container fails to run make note of the errors and make sure they are not already running.(this was one of my problems, I forgot it running in a different project and two similar services were not able to run at the same time on same ports).
  
  If you're feeling geeky use these commands to investigate:
  ```docker ps --all```
  ```docker images --all```
